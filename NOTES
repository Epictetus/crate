 *  pack all ruby source code that is installed and put it into the rubylibs
   table

 * generate a bootstrap piece of C code to overload the ruby main and launch
   into the basic code, running through the bootstrap table and evalling each
   piece of code as it goes through the system.

 * muster overwrites argc, argv in main, with only the options "-e 'Muster::boot'"

 * muster has a very small C-extension that deals with amalgalite, does low

   initial values, $" should be empty and so should $:

 * kill all other command line parsing
 * force all commandline options to be pushed to the script, push a '--' infront
   of the commands ?

 * set RUBYOPT in main and all the other RUBY ENV vars

 * rename output executable to 'something from Muster' file

 * Muster::boot() -- opens up an sqlitedatabase using the low level amalgalite
                     methods or sqlite directly.  Selects from a configured 
                     table 'default "muster"'  Interates over all the rows
                     evals each of the 'contents'
