* add in a list of rubylibs to be packed into the top level task similarly to
  what exists for the extensions
* expose the lib.db and app.db files to the commandline with reasonable defaults.
  automatically add the 'lib.db' and 'app.db'.  If the app.db doesn't exist do
  nothing with it. 
* add in dependency between default and :ruby tasks
