 *  Top level project should have everything that is in ext/Setup so that the
    user can pick what they want to install, this replaces the patch that goes
    for ruby Rakefile in that lib 

 *  pack all ruby source code that is installed and put it into the rubylibs
    table

 * generate a bootstrap piece of C code to overload the ruby main and launch
   into the basic code, running through the bootstrap table and evalling each
   piece of code as it goes through the system.

 * crate overwrites argc, argv in main, with only the options "-e 'Crate::boot'"

 * crate has a very small C-extension that deals with amalgalite, does low
   level calls to the appropriate table and does the boot loader.

 * kill all other command line parsing
 * force all commandline options to be pushed to the script, push a '--' infront
   of the commands ?

 * set RUBYOPT in main and all the other RUBY ENV vars

 * rename output executable to 'something from Crate' file

  id, filename, contents
